# What is GD3D.lib?

![alt tag](https://www.geoplanit.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/dashboard_01.png)

It's the start of a CityEngine library where we'll share some of our simple building block rule files.   
Some of the best rule and most used CityEngine rules are simple in regards to what they are doing, take for example the ESRI.lib Plant rules.  Focused and useful they allow an end user to focus on the project itself not a small but sometimes visually important aspect such as a tree.
## What GD3D.lib is not.
Well it's not as yet intended as a complete and complex CityEngine project such as the [Complete Streets Rule by David Wasserman](https://github.com/d-wasserman/Complete_Street_Rule).  It's also a work in progress!

### Thank you
A big thank you to David Wasserman, who has showed a model for sharing CityEngine rules online.  This is a humble attempt to replicate what he started and to further everyone's knowledge and understanding of Esri CityEngine.
